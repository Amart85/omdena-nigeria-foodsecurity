# Crop Disease Detection

This folder contains all the notebooks related in building models for crop disease detection

## Baseline Model
This model is our baseline to see if there is an improvement in other models we are going to make.
It has 2 convolutional layers and 2 max pooling layers and a fully connected layer as an output layer with 4 classes.
Image augmentation is applied to transform the images and increase the amount of training data.
